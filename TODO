  - Pick a project management service, and move TODOs to that service as user stories.

TODO:
  - Unit tests (Mocha + Enzyme?)
  - Continuous integration (Travis CI?)
  - Continuous deployment (Travis CI? AWS?)
  - Review view
  - Profile view
  - Gravatar support
  - Better markdown styling
  - Alternate version using GraphQL/Relay/Reindex?
