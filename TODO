TODO: Once the basic skeleton is ready, choose project management service and start tracking user stories

Next steps:
  - Firebase route protection (requires changing deckCards table to nest under uid)

At this point, ready to pick a project management service. Some stories to add:
  - Unit tests
  - Continuous integration
  - Continuous deployment
  - Review view
  - Profile view
  - Gravatar support
  - Markdown support
  - Alternate version using GraphQL/Relay/Reindex?
